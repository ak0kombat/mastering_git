why do we need to fork?
cuz, we dont have the permission to alter a github repo unless the owner of the repo allows us to. But still we need to use the repo so thats why we are forking the repo to our own account.

git clone "url of the repo"

#upstreaming (From where I have cloned the repo[the actual repo])
git remote add upstream "url"
